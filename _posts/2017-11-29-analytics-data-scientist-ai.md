It has been one year since I jumped on Data Science bandwagon. This article is me reflecting on what/where the journey has brought me.  

I have worked with data for almost ten years, mostly in data management, ETL, data warehouse etc. I thought data science seems to be a natural progression of where I need to be. Instead expanding skill to be able to call my self as 'data scientist', I got cought up in machine learning learning part of data science. It is a rabit hole that I haven't been able to get out off. Especially when one start to delve into 'cutting-egde' machine learning such as deep learning.

Machine learning is very different than say, to SQL, awk/sed/bash scripts, or ETL tools. One can easily can get started with SQL with basic understanding of SQL syntax. The same apply to script mentioned. Some ETL tools are even easier since they graphical, one simply has to drag and drop. In machine learning one has to learn new scripting language, learn machine learning models and, mathematics and algoritms behind those model.  

First is scripting language. Most people choose between R or Python as scripting language of choice for machine learning. I choose Python because it is more general scripting language so one can use Python for other than machine learning. Plus python is relatively easy scripting language to learn. Then there is machine learning models and mathematics behind those models. I never seen so much math since engineering school. Most people does not need to learn algorithms and math to get started with machine learning. There are many machine learning library available, one does not to program them themself. But I am tempted and cannot resists. 

So the past year I have spent time to learn machine learning. Sadly, the more i learned the more i forget. I am revisiting things I have learned/forgot in this blog. In the sense this blog is post-regession notes and journals.

## Where to start?

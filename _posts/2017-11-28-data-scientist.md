## Data scientist what's that?

Data scientist work with data but unlike any other job desc that work on data he/she leverage more on data by using machine learning techniques. One can leverage on data for different things from discovering new business insight to more exciting things such what deep learning have enable company such as Google to have incredible language translator (NLP), speech recognition, picture search etc. Those things at Google are possible because the availability of lots amount of data. 

In reality unless you work for tech company such as Google in most traditional business, data scientist are expected to help with business insight. If this so, how is data scientist different from data analyst and data engineer or Business intelligence/Analytics in general? One explanation that I really like is: 

    Data scientist combine statistic, engineering and visualization expertise. Data scientist is better engineer than data analyst and better statistician than data engineering. 

Data scientist have to have some grasp of statistic while understand machine learning more. Data scientist have to be able to do coding because she/he need to know how to model machine learning and new machine learning models are coming out almost everyday. And data scientist also need to grasp data infrastruture/achitecture because she/he need to know which tools and what data to use. 

It is a common knowledge that most data scientist time is used up to prepare data. There a lot of data available but most data are not cleaned and label. Labeled data is important if one wants to do supervise learing.  Thus data scientist have to do a lot of data wrangling and know which tools can help. Frankly tools changes every especially when one talk about big data and data visualization, data scientist must know what they need and subsequence tools. 

*Furthermore, to lesser extend, data scientist need to know about deployment. *
